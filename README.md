How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The best way is by writing proper unit tests and testing edge cases to make sure everything works as expected and bad inputs are taken care of. I also follow the requirements closely, so no functionality gets skipped, and I keep fields private with controlled updates to avoid security risks.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I read the requirements carefully and break them down into specific checks in my code, like making sure IDs have length limits or dates aren’t in the past. Then I use tests to confirm that those needs are met exactly as expected by the user.


How do I approach designing software?

I focus on keeping the design simple, clean, and easy to test by using separate classes for each feature like Contacts, Tasks, and Appointments. I also make sure fields can’t be changed directly if they’re not supposed to, doing this ensures that the system stays reliable.
